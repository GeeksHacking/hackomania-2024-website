## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Available Scripts

```5:11:package.json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "start": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro check && astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "astro": "astro"
  },
```

## Deployment

We used Cloudflare Pages to deploy the website.

To deploy the project on alternative platforms, you can use the following command to generate the static files for deploying to any static hosting service:
